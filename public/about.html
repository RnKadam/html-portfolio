<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aryan, I’ve been studying computer science for two years. In order to start my career before I graduate,
   I am looking for a post of a web developer,I have been creating website since past weeks or a month.Till now I am in a learning process,
   and as we know everyone learns a lot at different stages. 
    </p>

<p>I am a guy who enjoys gaming,travelling and spending time with friends, while not working or studying, 
  which takes most of my time.</p>

<p>If I should pick the best website I’ve designed up to this point, it will be these websites:
  [Birthday Invitation & Favourite Movie Rating]. I am ambitious and hard-working and I believe you’ll give me a chance to prove my words..</p>
